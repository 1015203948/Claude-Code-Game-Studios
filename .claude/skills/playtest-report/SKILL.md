## Phase 1: Parse Arguments

Determine the mode:

- `new` → generate a blank playtest report template
- `analyze [path]` → read raw notes and fill in the template with structured findings

---

## Phase 2A: New Template Mode

Generate this template and output it to the user:

```markdown
# Playtest Report

2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

## Phase 2B: Analyze Mode

Read the raw notes at the provided path. Cross-reference with existing design documents. Fill in the template above with structured findings. Flag any playtest observations that conflict with design intent.

---

## Phase 3: Action Routing

Categorize all findings into four buckets:

- **Design changes needed** — fun issues, player confusion, broken mechanics, observations that conflict with the GDD's intended experience
- **Balance adjustments** — numbers feel wrong, difficulty too spiked or too flat
- **Bug reports** — clear implementation defects that are reproducible
- **Polish items** — not blocking progress, but friction or feel issues for later

Present the categorized list, then route:

- **Design changes:** "Run `/propagate-design-change [path]` on the affected design document to find downstream impacts before making changes."
- **Balance adjustments:** "Run `/balance-check [system]` to verify the full balance picture before tuning values."
- **Bugs:** "Use `/bug-report` to formally track these."
- **Polish items:** "Add to the polish backlog in `production/` when the team reaches that phase."

---

## Phase 4: Save Report

Ask: "May I write this playtest report to `production/qa/playtests/playtest-[date]-[tester].md`?"

If yes, write the file, creating the directory if needed.

---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — playtest report generated.

- Act on the highest-priority finding category first.
- After addressing design changes: re-run `/design-review` on the updated GDD.
- After fixing bugs: re-run `/bug-triage` to update priorities.
